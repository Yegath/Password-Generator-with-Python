## README
In this project, I made a password generator which specified by user: 
 -  User can decide how many passwords would like to generate and what length would like password be.
 -  If the user wishes, user can use only letters, only numbers or both in a mixed form in the password. 
 -  Optional special character can be added if at least one of the letter or number category is used. 
 
 The reason of I did this project is improving my python skills and sharing what i did.
